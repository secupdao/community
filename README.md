## Scope

We expect all members of the community to abide by this Code of Conduct at all times in all community venues, online and in person, and in one-on-one communications.

This policy applies to behavior in the context of the Open Source project communities, including but not limited to public GitHub repositories, chat channels, social media, mailing lists, and public events.

This Code of Conduct is in addition to, and does not in any way nullify or invalidate, any other terms or conditions related to use of third-party services.

The definitions of various subjective terms such as "discriminatory", "hateful", or "confusing" will be decided at the sole discretion of the [Abuse team](#contact-info).

## Friendly Harassment-Free Space

We are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all, regardless of gender identity, sexual orientation, disability, ethnicity, religion, age, physical appearance, body size, race, or similar personal characteristics.

We ask that you please respect that people have differences of opinion regarding technical choices, and that every design or implementation choice carries a trade-off and numerous costs. There is seldom a single right answer. A difference of technology preferences is not a license to be rude.

Any spamming, trolling, flaming, baiting, or other attention-stealing behavior is not welcome, and will not be tolerated.

Harassing other users is never tolerated, whether via public or private media.

Avoid using offensive or harassing nicknames, or other identifiers that might detract from a friendly, safe, and welcoming environment for all.

Harassment includes, but is not limited to: any behavior that threatens or demeans another person or group, or produces an unsafe environment; harmful or prejudicial verbal or written comments related to gender, gender expression, gender identity, sexual orientation, disability, ethnicity, religion, age, physical appearance, body size, race, or similar personal characteristics; inappropriate use of nudity, sexual images, and/or sexually explicit language in public spaces; threats of physical or non-physical harm; deliberate intimidation, stalking or following; harassing photography or recording; sustained disruption of talks or other events; inappropriate physical contact; and unwelcome sexual attention.

## Reporting Violations of this Code of Conduct

If you believe someone is harassing you or has otherwise violated this Code of Conduct, please [contact us](#contact-info) to send us an abuse report. If this is the initial report of a problem, please include as much detail as possible. It is easiest for us to address issues when we have more context.


## Copyright Violations

We respect the intellectual property of others and ask that you do too. Please, make sure the code you contribute is yours. We won't accept code that violates a copyright. Please let us know if our code is infringing any copyrights through our [contacts](#contact-info) below.

## Consequences

Unacceptable behavior from any community member will not be tolerated.

Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately.

If a community member engages in unacceptable behavior, the DAO may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including a temporary ban or permanent expulsion from the community without warning.

## Addressing Grievances

If you feel you have been falsely or unfairly accused of violating this Code of Conduct, you should notify the DAO. We will do our best to ensure that your grievance is handled appropriately.

In general, we will choose the course of action that we judge as being most in the interest of fostering a safe and friendly community.

On Telegram, tag our @admins and let them know if you think that someone has transgressed against the Code of Conduct. Our Telegram admins will forward your report to the DAO abuse team.

## Contact Info

The most effective way to get in contact with our community is through our [Telegram](https://t.me/secupdao).

If you need to report a problem or privately address an abuse report, please contact directly the [abuse team](mailto:abuse@secup.org) through email.

We will keep all matters confidential and they will only be shared within the partners, with the exception of legal counsel when deemed necessary, or unless given explicit permission by the reporter.

You are also encouraged to ask our [Telegram](https://t.me/secupdao) about something that might be "on the line" between appropriate and inappropriate content. We are happy to provide guidance to help you be a successful part of our community.
